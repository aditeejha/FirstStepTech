        and how to start learning it.

    <h2>About the Creator</h2>

    <p>
        Hi, I’m Aditee Jha, a Computer Science undergraduate at
        Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra. As of December 2025,
        I am in my second year of the program.
    </p>

    <p>
        I built FirstStepTech as a learning project using only HTML and CSS.
        The idea behind this platform came from my own experience of feeling
        overwhelmed while choosing what to learn in tech and where to begin.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project reflects my interest in structured learning, clarity,
        and building simple solutions for real problems faced by beginners
        in technology.
    </p>
